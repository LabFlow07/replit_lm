# License Management Platform (QLM-Style)

## Overview

This is a software license management platform inspired by Quick License Manager (QLM), designed to handle license activation, client management, and multi-tier organizational structures. The system provides a comprehensive solution for managing software licenses with support for different license types (permanent, trial, subscription), device binding, and hierarchical user roles (superadmin, resellers, agents, clients).

The platform features a React-based frontend with a clean dashboard interface and an Express.js backend with RESTful APIs for license operations, client management, and analytics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

**August 18, 2025 - Company Hierarchy Authorization Filter Implementation**
- **RESOLVED: Admin users now see only their company's registrations**
  - Problem: Admin users (like "cmh") were seeing all system registrations instead of only their company's data
  - Solution: Implemented hierarchical filtering in `/api/software/registrazioni` endpoint
  - Logic: Admin users see registrations from their company and all sub-companies in the hierarchy
  - Results: Admin "cmh" (Cmh company) now sees 3 filtered registrations instead of all 20 system registrations
  - Maintains superadmin access to all data while restricting admin visibility appropriately
- **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
  - Enhanced software registrations endpoint with role-based filtering
  - Integrated existing `getCompanyHierarchy()` function for proper parent-child company relationships
  - Added comprehensive logging with emoji debugging for monitoring filter application
  - Filter logic checks both direct license assignments and company name matching
  - Superadmin retains full system visibility while admin roles are properly restricted

**August 18, 2025 - Complete License Expiry Management System FULLY RESOLVED**
- **FINAL FIX: Corrected API endpoint field mapping issue**
  - Problem: GET `/api/licenses` and `/api/licenses/:id` endpoints were querying wrong database field (`expiration_date` instead of `expiry_date`)
  - Solution: Updated both endpoints to correctly map `row.expiry_date` to response `expiryDate` field
  - Frontend now correctly displays license expiry dates in the "Scadenza" column with color coding
- Implemented comprehensive license expiry calculation and management system
- Fixed automatic expiry date calculation for all license types (trial, monthly, yearly subscriptions)
- Added license activation workflow with automatic expiry calculation during software registration classification
- Created web interface with color-coded expiry display (red=expired, orange=expiring soon, green=ok)
- Implemented admin control buttons: "Aggiorna Scadenze" and "Processa Rinnovi" for manual system management
- **RESOLVED: Fixed MySQL datetime format compatibility issue**
  - Problem: Database rejected ISO datetime strings (2025-08-16T17:45:05.948Z format)
  - Solution: Added automatic conversion to MySQL format (2025-08-16 17:45:05) in updateLicense function
  - Both activation dates and expiry dates now correctly stored and displayed
- Successfully tested with pippo2's monthly license - now shows correct activation and 30-day expiry dates
- License classification workflow fully functional with automatic date assignment
- Automatic renewal processing system active and functional (processes licenses expiring within 7 days)
- Status: COMPLETE - All license expiry functionality working correctly with proper database storage and frontend display

**August 18, 2025 - Automatic License Renewal System Implementation**
- **IMPLEMENTED: Complete automatic renewal system for midnight processing**
  - Added comprehensive automatic renewal logic that processes licenses with `renewal_enabled = true`
  - System activates at 00:00 (Europe/Rome timezone) using node-cron scheduler
  - Only processes active subscription licenses (monthly/yearly) that are expired or expiring today
  - Automatically generates renewal transactions with proper pricing and discount application
  - Updates license expiry dates from current date to avoid gaps in coverage
  - Enhanced logging with emojis for better monitoring and debugging
- **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
  - Added `startAutomaticRenewalScheduler()` function with cron job scheduling
  - Improved `processAutomaticRenewals()` to handle only licenses with auto-renewal enabled
  - Integrated scheduler activation in server startup sequence
  - Manual trigger endpoint available at `/api/licenses/process-renewals` for admin testing
  - System respects license type constraints (no renewal for permanent/trial licenses)
- **BUSINESS LOGIC:**
  - Renewal transactions automatically created with same pricing rules as original license
  - License notes updated with renewal date tracking
  - Status maintained as 'attiva' during renewal process
  - Error handling ensures partial failures don't stop entire renewal batch
- Status: ACTIVE - Automatic renewal system operational and scheduled for daily execution

**August 16, 2025 - Database Authentication Fix**
- Fixed critical authentication issue where login worked but data retrieval failed
- Problem: `DatabaseStorage` class was using mock database instead of real MariaDB connection
- Solution: Corrected database references to use actual database connection
- Fixed MySQL boolean compatibility (`is_active = TRUE` â†’ `is_active = 1`)
- Status: All data retrieval now working correctly (users, companies, clients, products, licenses)
- Default login credentials confirmed working: admin/admin123
