## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the License Management Platform, please help us maintain the security of the project by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to `security@yourproject.com`
2. **Subject**: Include "Security Vulnerability" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Provide as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Security Best Practices

When using this software:

#### Environment Variables
- Always use strong, unique `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate secrets regularly

#### Database Security
- Use secure database credentials
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Regularly backup and test restore procedures
- Keep database software updated

#### Authentication
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly audit user permissions

#### Application Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security audits regularly: `npm audit`
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries (already implemented)

### Known Security Considerations

1. **JWT Secret**: The application uses JWT tokens. Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is cryptographically secure
2. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
3. **SQL Injection**: Protected through parameterized queries
4. **XSS Protection**: React provides built-in XSS protection for rendered content
5. **CSRF**: Consider implementing CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Announced in release notes
- Tagged with "security" label

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- Provide credit in our security advisories (if desired)
- Not take legal action against good-faith security research
- Maintain confidentiality until a fix is released

### Security Checklist for Deployments

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set secure `JWT_SECRET`
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] Set up database with secure credentials
- [ ] Enable firewall and network security
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Review and harden server configuration
- [ ] Set up automated security updates
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
